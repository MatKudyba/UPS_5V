# UPS_5V
This is my engineering project solution about power backup low voltage- mini 5V UPS. Main element of system storage energy is supercapacitor and buck-boost converter TPS61040x series. This solution is base on LtSpice simulations. In zip there are KiCad design files and GBR production files.
